      <h1>Style of play and reception</h1>
        <p>Regarded as one of the best players of his generation, Kaká has been described on the FIFA website as having the "capacity to glide almost effortlessly past opponents, provide defence-splitting passes and score consistently from distance."[203][204][205] During his prime at Milan in the mid to late 2000s, and prior to the injuries he suffered at Real Madrid which affected his mobility, Kaká was a quick, agile, hard-working, highly skilful and creative team player with great pace, ball control, movement, and balance, capable of dribbling past defenders in one on one situations as well as during counterattacks.[206][207][208][209][210] Regarding his speed and elegance on the ball, in 2017, Karl Matchett of Bleacher Report stated:

"His gait, particularly when in possession, was mesmeric. Reasonably unusual in stature for a playmaking midfielder at a little over six feet tall, Kaká could still turn and accelerate past a defender in the same way the smaller, low-centre-of-gravity No. 10s would manage—but that same elegant, long-legged stride made him unstoppable on the run."</p>
